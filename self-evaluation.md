# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?

Working with arrays allows you to group variables together, but on top of that, each allows you to do something for each item in the array with just 1 block of code, you don't have to do it individually.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?

I don't know but I'm having fun, i need to get comfortable with how many arguments certain standard methods take.

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?

not trying to add in code we havn't covered yet.
